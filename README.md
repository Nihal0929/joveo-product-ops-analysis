# JOVEO – Product Operations Take-Home Exercise

This repository contains my analysis and insights for the **Product Operations** take-home exercise at JOVEO.

The work focuses on understanding job-level campaign performance over a 30-day period and identifying opportunities for efficiency, spend optimization, and application growth.

## Dataset Overview
- Time period: December 1–31, 2025
- Records: ~5,000 daily job-level entries
- Unique jobs: 714
- Key metrics: Clicks, Applications, Spend, CPA, Conversion Rate

## Key Highlights
- $77,715 total spend generated 12,131 applications (overall CPA: $6.41)
- ~68% of applications came from just 10% of jobs (high concentration)
- ~$6.3k spent on jobs that generated zero applications
- Significant end-of-month performance drop (~79% decline in last 5 days)
- Large geographic and category-level efficiency variance

## Contents
- `joveo_product_ops_analysis.ipynb`  
  Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data exploration & aggregation  
  - Job-level, geographic, and category analysis  
  - CPA and conversion efficiency diagnostics  
  - Actionable recommendations  

- `JOVEO_Performance_Analysis_Report.pdf` (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OFlnBrE072vJLzYC55E0MnMqzp1Mzr2AbtReZehvG1I/edit?usp=sharing)  
  Structured report summarizing findings, insights, assumptions, and recommendations.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization libraries
- Spreadsheet-based validation

## Objective
To demonstrate analytical thinking, structured problem-solving, and the ability to translate performance data into clear, actionable insights relevant to Product Operations.

## Notes
The emphasis of this exercise is on clarity of approach, reasoning, and decision-oriented insights rather than perfect outputs.
